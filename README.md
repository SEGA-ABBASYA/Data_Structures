**WRANA SECTION (ورانا سكشن)** is a smart **3D navigation system** designed for students at the [Faculty of Computer and Information Science - ASU](https://cis.asu.edu.eg/). Developed as part of the **Data Structures course**, this project helps students efficiently navigate the campus, find the shortest paths to their lectures, labs, and sections, and interact with friends in real-time.

The system models the university as a **graph**, implementing **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** for efficient pathfinding. It features **3D floor models** of the faculty, a **friendship system**, **messaging features**, and **personalized schedule-based guidance**.

## Key Features

### User Features
- **Faculty Navigation**
  - **Shortest path calculation** between any two points using real-world blueprints.
  - **Distance display:** Displays the approximate distances (in steps) for computed paths.
  - **Live Step Tracking:** Displays steps count while navigating and decrements as you move.
- **Personalized schedule-based guidance.**
- **Friendship System:** Add/remove friends and track their potential location within the building.
- **Course Management:** Add, remove, and manage registered courses.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Receive and manage important updates.

### Admin Features
- **Course Management:** Add, edit, or delete courses.
- **Building Graph Management:** Modify room locations and paths.
- **Student Info Management:** Add, edit, or remove student records.
- **Schedule Management:** Add or remove courses from level schedules.

### GUI and 3D Mapping
- **Fully interactive 3D visualization** of the faculty using accurate real-world measurements.
- **Seamless user experience** through a Qt-based GUI.
- **Interactive navigation** that updates in real-time as users move.
